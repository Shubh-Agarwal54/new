New 7 Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2000 to choose Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing 
monuments. The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small amounts of telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss 
Bernard Weber and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation (N7W) based in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on 
7 July 2007 in Lisbon, at Est√°dio da Luz. The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was possible for people to 
cast multiple votes. According to John Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling 
organization Zogby International, New 7 Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".</P><BR>

The program drew a wide range of official reactions. Some countries touted their finalist and tried to get more votes cast 
for it, while others downplayed or criticized the contest. After supporting the New 7 Wonders Foundation at the beginning 
of the campaign by providing advice on nominee selection, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), by its bylaws having to record all and give equal status to world heritage sites, distanced itself 
from the undertaking in 2001 and again in 2007.</P>
